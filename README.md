# @passmarked/suite

> This project is the future iteration of where the team sees Passmarked going and working more tightly together with the Lighthouse team's outputs produced from a already large suite of audits by Lighthouse itself. More to follow as we finish this up and details for anyone to run their own version of Passmarked rule audits for local usage as well.

[Passmarked](http://passmarked.com?source=github&report=suite) is a suite of tests that can be run against any page/website to identify issues with parity to most online tools in one package.

All of the checks on [Passmarked](http://passmarked.com?source=github&report=ssl) can be voted on importance and are [open-sourced](http://github.com/passmarked/suite), to encourage community involvement in fixing and adding new rules. We are building the living Web Standard and love any [contributions](#contributing).

To learn more visit:
